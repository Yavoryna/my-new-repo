# my-new-repo

### Let's start!

- This is my first project in GitHub)
  
##What did I do?##

- I configured my PyCharm to work with GitHub and my branch, and also with interpreters:
  
  `git clone https://github.com/Yavoryna/my-new-repo.git`
  
  `cd my-new-repo`
- Then I connected my project to HTTP and started it;
- Secondly, I check my requirements:
  
  `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
- Finally I put the whole project(main.py) in my branch (api) in GitHub.

**And now I am doing the README.md and remembering all steps that I did.**
